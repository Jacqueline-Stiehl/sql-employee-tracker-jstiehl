## Description/What I attempted to do

Create a command-line application that displays and alters employee information stored in databases based on user input. The application is run by entering the comman "node index.js" into the terminal. I built this application as a way to store and modify work data. As part of this project, I learned how to use MySQL to generate and manage a database.
